# OMEGA Game Engine [WIP]

 This is an amalgamation of all my game engines that I made in the span of 10 years. Currently work in progress;

 **This is using**:

 - C# .NET 5.0
 - SDL2/[SDL2-CS][10] for window creation, graphics context, mouse, keyboard and gamepad input;
 - [BGFX][1] for low level graphics API abstraction;
 - [StbImageSharp][9] for image loading/writing;
 - Code fragments from [SharpBGFX][2] and [bgfx-cs][3] to help better abstract low level bindings;
 - Game loop code from https://github.com/TylerGlaiel/FrameTimingControl;
 - [FontBM][12] for generating bitmap fonts; 
 - Binary parsing code from [Cyotek BitmapFont][13] for parsing binary .FNT file generated by FontBM;
 - [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET) and [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/imgui.h);

 **This project has taken inspiration or is using code directly from:**

 - [Sokol][4]
 - [Vortex2D (RIP: First game engine I studied and used)][5]
 - [HGE Game Engine (RIP: One of the first game engines I've studied)][6]
 - [LibGDX (Learned low level (OpenGL level) graphics code from it)][11]
 - [MonoGame (Using input code from it)][7]
 - [FNA][8]
